## About CPI

*Consumer Price Indices (CPI)* measure changes over time in general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. CPI numbers are widely used as a macroeconomic indicator of inflation, as a tool by governments and central banks for inflation targeting and for monitoring price stability, and as deflators in the national accounts. CPI is also used for indexing dearness allowance to employees for increase in prices. CPI is therefore considered as one of the most important economic indicators. For construction of CPI numbers, two requisite components are weighting diagrams (consumption patterns) and price data collected at regular intervals. The Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation releases Consumer Price Indices (CPI) on base 2010=100 for all-India and States/UTs separately for rural, urban and combined every month with effect from January, 2011. The data is Published by Central Statistical Office and released on 12th of every month.
